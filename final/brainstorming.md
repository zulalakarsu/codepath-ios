# Evaluation


## 1 Focal
Description:
A minimalist productivity app that helps users stay focused by combining Pomodoro-style time management with goal-setting, ambient soundscapes, and distraction-blocking features. Users can create focus sessions, set small goals per session, choose background audio (like ambient or binaural beats), and block interruptions like notifications or accidental screen taps.

Story:
In a world full of distractions, people crave calm, intention, and results. This app tells a story of taking back control—building productivity rituals that work with your brain, not against it.

Market:
Gen Z, university students, young professionals, ADHD or neurodivergent users, and people working/studying from home. Competitors include Forest, Focus Keeper, and Tide – but this app aims to uniquely blend intentional planning, soothing focus aids, and system-level distraction control.

Mobile:
This app is designed for mobile-first, with a deeply immersive and real-time experience centered around focus and ambient sound.

Habit:
* Daily planning of focus sessions
* Associating small goals with sessions (habit stacking)
* Using ambient/binaural audio to induce flow
* Reducing digital fatigue and mindless scrolling

Scope:
MVP could include:
* Timer with Pomodoro and custom durations
* Goal input and tagging for each session
* Ambient/binaural audio selection
* Basic distraction blocking (screen tap lock + guided setup for Do Not Disturb)
* Daily summary of time spent + goals completed

Future additions:
* Streaks and habit tracking
* Session history and productivity analytics
* App usage limiter (Screen Time API)
* iCloud sync or Apple Health/FitnessKit integrations
* Optional calming visuals or breathwork guides
